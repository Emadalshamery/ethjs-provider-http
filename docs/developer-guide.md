## Dependancies

 - "xhr2": "0.1.3" -- https://www.npmjs.com/package/xhr2

## NPM Practice

Across all `ethjs-` repos, we enforce version hardening (i.e. "0.0.3" not "^0.0.3"). We want to reduce potential hazardous install changes from dependancies as much as possible to ensure package preformace, testing, security and design. Please make sure all your commits and PR's are version hardend if you are installing or removing new packages.

## Chanelog

All relevant changes are notated in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, moniter this file for changes to this repository.

## Travis-ci and Coveralls Practice

Across all `ethjs-` repos, we enforce mandatory travis-ci and coveralls testing. We never `commit to master`. As a general policy, Coveralls.io results must always be above 95% for any `ethjs-` PR or commit. We want to ensure complete coverage across the board.
